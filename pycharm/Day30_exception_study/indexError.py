# <ISSUE>
# We've got some buggy code. Try running the code. The code will crash and give
# you an IndexError. This is because we're looking through the list of fruits
# for index that is out of range.

# <OBJECTIVE>
# Use what you've learnt about exception handling to prevent
# the program from crashing. If the user enters something
# that is out of range just print a default output of "Fruit pie".

fruits = eval(input())
# ðŸš¨ Do not change the code above

# TODO: Catch the exception and make sure the code runs without crashing.
def make_pie(index):
    try:
        fruit = fruits[index]
        print(fruit + " pie")
    except IndexError:
        print("Fruit pie")
    else:
        print(fruit + " pie")

# ðŸš¨ Do not change the code below
make_pie(4)

# input -> ["Apple", "Pear", "Orange"]
# Example Output -> Fruit pie
